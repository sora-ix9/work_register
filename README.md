# Work Register: A Real-Time Face Detection And Registration System
The system composes two-key components, i.e. web client and web server, where web client is responsible for fetching raw images from user camera and displaying face-detected images received from web server. On the other hand, web server is responsible for detecting faces on images received from web client by using YOLOv8n model.  Lastly, both web client and server perform their task in real-time implemented by WebSoecket.
